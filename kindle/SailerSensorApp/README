Preconditions:
==============
- JDK installed
- ant installed and found in system path
- A copy of the Kindlet-1.3.jar
- Edit build.xml line 8, and change the kindlet.lib.path to point to your local Kindlet-1.3.jar


Keystore
========
To be able to run the SailerSensor app on your Kindle, you need to merge
the SailerSensor app keystore into your Kindle device developer.keystore

1) Copy (USBNetwork/scp) the Kindle developer.keystore somewhere
   scp root@{KINDLE_IP}:/var/local/java/keystore/developer.keystore .

2) Run keytool to merge the sailersensor.keystore into the developer.keystore
   keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore sailersensor.keystore -destkeystore developer.keystore

3) Copy the developer.keystore back
   scp developer.keystore root@{KINDLE_UP}:/var/local/java/keystore/

4) Restart the Kindle

5) Install the app

Building/deploying
==================
- Configure & run the deploy deploy.sh script
- The script runs ant.jar, creates the SailerSensorApp.azw2, and tries to copy (scp)
  it into the Kindle device
- For scp to work, you need the Kindle to be connected (USBNetwork),
  and set the SSH_IP to point to your Kindle IP
